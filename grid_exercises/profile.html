        <p>My favorite book is One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish by Doctor Suess! It's a really good read and I would highly recommend it. It was published March 12, 1960, and has since become one of the best selling children's books of all time. </p>
        <p>This book has a lot of rhyming and a fun rhythm. It mentions two characters, Jay and Kay, and all their amazing animal friends. </p>
